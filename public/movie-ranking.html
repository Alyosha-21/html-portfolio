<h1>My Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I love the imagination, the imagery, and the core story.</p>
<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>The story spoke to me and my love for nature. I shed a tear or too. Nobody died. I know.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>A mind bender and a thriller, each time I watch Inception I get more out of it.</p>
